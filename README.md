# When manually adding test data, name the file "test_(INT).json" and place in ./papers. Make sure there are no duplicates file names.

# Follow standard JSON formatting and ensure you enter data as shown
#   {
#       "question":"QUESTION",
#       "classification":"CLASSIFICATION",
#   }

# classification is case sensitive. There are no preset classifications except for those used in the sample training data

# If the program outputs the wrong classification, manually change the classification accordingly and rename the file as "test_(INT).json"
