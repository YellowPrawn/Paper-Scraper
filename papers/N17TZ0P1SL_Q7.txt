 Consider the following algorithm, where N is a positive integer.
 loop for K from 1 to N
      loop for J from 1 to N
        if K = J then
          output  K
        end if
      end loop
 end loop
 (a) Determine the number of times the comparison K = J will be performed.[1]
 (b) Determine the number of times the statement output K will be executed.[1]
 (c) Construct the algorithm which performs the same task using a single while loop, 
instead of nested for loops.[4]
