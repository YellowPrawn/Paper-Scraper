 An oil and gas company has a networked computer system for use of their employees in the 
Head Office.
(a)  (i)   Identify one hardware security measure that will ensure that confidential data 
from the Head Office cannot be accessed. [1]
(ii)  Identify one software security measure that will ensure that confidential data from 
the Head Office cannot be accessed. [1]
The company also uses the internet to enable communication with employees working on 
exploration and production in many remote geographical areas.
(b) Identify one network security measure. [1]
The sub-sea oil and gas exploration and production unit of the company relies on thousands 
of kilometres of pipeline which are monitored by a computer control system which can detect 
leaks.
(c) Explain the environmental benefit of using a computer control system to monitor the 
pipeline.                                                                                                                                   [3]                                                                                                                                   
The process of detecting leaks is carried out by sensors which are continuously monitoring 
changes in the flow and pressure of the liquids in the pipes.
This data is processed on a computer in the office.
If any of sensor values are outside of the acceptable parameters stored on a disk in the 
office, the following error routines are performed:
• an alarm is sounded on the computer at the office
• an email message is sent to managers in the Head Office.
A member of staff can also configure the system. 
(d)  Explain the relationship between sensors, output transducers and processor in this 
situation.                                                                                                                                  [4]
(e)  Construct a system flowchart to represent the process described above. [5]
