 A medical centre uses a computer system to manage both patients’ data and appointments.  
This system, which is used by the doctors, nurses and secretaries, has two unordered files: 
a patients’ file and an appointments’ file, both of which can only be accessed sequentially.
    Every evening the following processing takes place:
• a list of appointments for the next day is printed out
• reminders are sent by SMS text messages to the patients’ mobile devices.
(a) Outline the pseudocode that the processing must follow when the system sends out the 
text reminders. [5]
(b)     Describe     two different methods that the medical centre could use that would allow data 
to be restored should it be lost for any reason. [4]
The medical centre is concerned about the privacy of the data it is storing and has to make 
decisions concerning:
• access to the data stored on this system 
• storing the data locally or through the use of a cloud service.
(c) Discuss the issues that should be considered before making these decisions. [6]
