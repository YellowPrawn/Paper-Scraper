 The collection WEATHER contains the temperatures that have been measured for one city 
over the course of one week, starting on Monday and ending on Sunday.  Each day,  
24 readings were taken, one each hour, the first	being	at	00:00,	the	second	at	01:00	and	so	
on.  The data is stored in chronological order with the data for Monday stored in the collection 
first,	followed	by	Tuesday and so on.
         (a)         State the total number of readings that were taken during this week. [1]
         (b)         Construct the algorithm to read this data into a 2D array, A, that would allow the 
temperature on	a	specific	day	at	a	specific	time	to	be	accessed directly.[4]
         (c)         Construct the algorithm that will output the day, as a word (for example Tuesday), on 
which the highest temperature was recorded.[6]
 The process described at the start of question 15 is extended so that each week the value 
and date of the highest temperature recorded that week are stored chronologically in a 
collection, HIGHEST.
At any point in time, the data from the HIGHEST collection can be read into a suitable 
data structure that will allow the details of the highest temperatures recorded to be 
output	in	descending	order.		The	structure	is	chosen	in	order	to	minimize	processing.
         (d)         Explain how a suitable data structure can be constructed and used for this purpose. [4]
