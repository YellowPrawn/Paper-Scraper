 Consider the following diagram and pseudocode for drawing on a display screen.
2 × SIZE
CENTRE
SIZE
ENDPOINT
ENDPOINTS = drawH(CENTRE, SIZE)
The method drawH(CENTRE, SIZE) will draw an “H” located at CENTRE with width of SIZE 
and  height  of  
×2
 
SIZE,  as  shown.    It  returns  an  array  containing  the  four  endpoints  of  the  
vertical lines.
In the following flowchart, POINTS1 is a stack.
draw H
at CENTRE
Is
POINTS1
empty?
no
yes
pop CENTRE
from POINTS1
(a)    Construct pseudocode corresponding to the flowchart.

(Question 14 continued)
(b)    Construct the drawing that would be produced by the flowchart on page 6 if it is preceded 
by the following steps.
SIZE = 20
CENTRE = the middle of the user’s display
POINTS1 is a stack, initially empty
ENDPOINTS = drawH(CENTRE, SIZE)
loop COUNT from 0 to 3
POINTS1.push(ENDPOINTS[COUNT])
end loop
SIZE = SIZE / 2
[2]
The pattern of drawing a new set of H’s, which have a SIZE value that is half the SIZE value 
of the previous H, can be repeated.  Each set of H’s of the same size is called a generation.
(c) Construct an algorithm that will draw an initial H in the centre of the display and three 
generations after that.
[6]
(d) State how many endpoints there will be after the initial H and three generations have been 
drawn, without any consideration of the size.  
[1]
(e) Suggest how drawing this pattern of H’s could be done recursively.
