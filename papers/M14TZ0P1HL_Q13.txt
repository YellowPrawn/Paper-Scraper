 The faceplate of a car stereo has six buttons for selecting one of six preferred radio stations.  
As part of the internal representation of a microprocessor there is an array with six positions, 
carrying the information about the radio frequencies, as follows.
Radio
[0][1][2][3][4][5]
100.488.790.2104.593.8106.2
(a) State the information at Radio[2].  
[1]
(b)    Outline how a numerical frequency could be stored in a fixed-length string. 
[2]
(c)   Construct   an   algorithm   in   pseudocode   that   calculates   the   range   of   frequencies    
(ie the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies) of any set of six selected 
radio stations. 
[6]
The  two-dimensional  array  
Stats provides an indication of how often a specific station is 
listened to by the user.  For each button in the faceplate it records how often it has been clicked 
in the last 48 hours.  
Stats is ordered by the second column.

Stats
Both Radio and Stats are used by a procedure that allows the user to access the radio frequencies 
that are listened to most often, as recorded in 
Stats, by flicking a lever on the steering wheel.  
The frequencies are accessed cyclically, ie after the least used frequency the procedure returns 
to the most used.  For this reason a queue Q is used.
(d)  Construct  an  algorithm  in  pseudocode  that,  by  using  the  structures  
Radio  and  Stats, 
performs the following steps:
• it inserts the radio frequencies in the queue Q, following the actual order of preference; 
and then
• it uses the queue Q, cyclically, to output an element each time the lever is flicked.
