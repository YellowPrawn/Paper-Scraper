 The following method, calcBMI() accepts person’s height (H) in metres (m) and weight (W) 
in kilograms (kg) and returns their Body Mass Index (BMI).
    calcBMI(H, W)
     X = H * H
      B = W / X
      return  B
    endcalcBMI
Boris weighs 104 kg and is 2.00 m tall. His BMI can be calculated by calling method 
calcBMI() as follows
BorisBMI = calcBMI(2.00, 104).
(a) State the value of variable BorisBMI.  [1]
A person can belong to one of the following four weight categories:
BMIWeight category

from 25.0 but less than 30.0overweight
greater than or equal to 30.0 obese
(b) Use pseudocode to construct an algorithm which accepts a person’s BMI and outputs
