 A suburban railway system for a large city in Southern Europe consists of two lines L1 and L2,  
which  meet  at  the  station  Centro,  where  passengers  can  change  from  one  line  to  the  other.     
The system is shown below.

Each station is located in a particular zone, and the total number of zones in which the journey 
takes place determines the train fare.  Note, if a passenger starts in Zone 1, goes to Zone 0 and 
then back to Zone 1, the journey has taken place in three zones.  Examples of the number of 
zones are shown below for different journeys.

(a) State the number of zones in which the journey takes place when travelling from Alora  
to Fuengirola. 
[1]
The  data  for  each  station  (station  name,  line,  zone)  is  stored  on  the  system’s  server  in  the  
collection 
TRAIN_DATA.  There are 12 stations in total.  The first part of the collection is  
shown below.
Centro,  L1,  0,  Alora,  L1,  3,  Torrox,  L1,  1,  Col,  L2,  1,  ... 
From this we can see that Alora is part of line L1 and is located in Zone 3.
At the start of each day, the data in 
TRAIN_DATA is read in to the binary tree TREE, in which 
each node will hold the data for one station.  The binary tree will be used to search for a specific 
station’s name.
(b)    Sketch  the  binary  tree  after  the  station  data  from  the  first  part  of  the  collection,  
given above, has been added.

(Question 15 continued)
The 
TRAIN_DATA   collection   is   also   used   to   construct   the   one-dimensional   array    
STATIONS  (which  only  contains  the  list  of  station  names  sorted  into  alphabetical  order),   
where 
STATIONS[0] = Alamo.
(c) State the value of 
STATIONS[4]. 
[1]
The two data structures (
STATIONS and TREE) are now used to construct the two-dimensional 
array 
FARES containing the fares between stations, partly shown below.  Note that the fare for 
travelling in each zone is €1.00.

(d) Calculate the fare for travelling from Torrox to Lima.
[1]
(e)  Construct  the  algorithm  that  would  calculate  the  fares  for  this  two-dimensional  array.     
You can make use of the following two sub-procedures:
• TREE.getZone(STATION) // which returns the zone in which the 
  // station is located
• TREE.getLine(STATION) // which returns the line on which the 
    //     station is located
Your algorithm should make as few calculations as possible.
