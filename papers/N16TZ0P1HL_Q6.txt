 Consider the following recursive algorithm 
FUN(X, N), where X and N are two integers.
FUN(X, N)
if N<=0 then
return 1
else
return X*FUN(X, N-1)
end if
The return statement gives the value that the algorithm generates.
(a) Determine how many times multiplication is performed when this algorithm is executed. [1]
(b) Determine the value of 
FUN(2,3), showing all of your working. [3]
(c) State the purpose of this recursive algorithm. [1]
