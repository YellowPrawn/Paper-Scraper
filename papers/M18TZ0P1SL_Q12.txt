 (a) The collection DATA contains the following data:
2,  4,  1,  −2,  −4,  1,  0
    Consider the following pseudocode:
COUNTER = 0
SUM = 0
DATA.resetNext()
loop for X from 0 to 6
  if DATA.getNext() > 0
   ARRAY[X] = DATA.getNext()
   COUNTER = COUNTER + 1
   SUM = SUM + ARRAY[X]
  end if
end loop
output SUM/COUNTER
Trace the pseudocode using the table below: [4]
XARRAY[X]COUNTERSUMoutput
A transport authority is investigating how many people use a certain direct train route, which 
is used every day of the week.
At the end of each day, the total number of passengers who travelled on this route is stored 
in a collection, PASSENGERS. 
The first item was written to the collection on Monday 1st January 2018.
212
The next items, collected on Tuesday and Wednesday, were added like this:
212                   454               342 
(b)    Assuming that the first item read from the collection is from Monday 1st January 2018, 
construct pseudocode that will read PASSENGERS into an array, P_ARRAY.                            [4]
(c)     Using     P_ARRAY, construct pseudocode to output the day of the week with the highest 
average number of passengers.  Use the sub procedure convert() which converts 
the numbers 0 to 6 into days of the week, for example convert(1) will return “Tuesday”.
 Note: you should not assume that data for an exact number of weeks is stored. [7]
