 A book shop has a computer at each point of sale, and also a central computer.
When a customer buys a book in the book shop, the salesperson at the point of sale uses a  
scanning device to input a barcode from the book.  
The barcode is sent to the central computer where the barcode of each book and the 
corresponding price are held in a database on a disk.
When the price is found, it is sent to the point of sale computer where all necessary  
calculations are performed, details of the transaction are stored on a local disk and a receipt 
is printed out.
(a)	    Construct	a	system	flow	chart	for	the	system	described	above.	[5]
At the point of sale there are peripheral devices other than the scanning device and printer.
(b) Outline the purpose of one other possible peripheral device in this scenario. [2]
The customers can also buy books online.  A customer can select a book, and then enter 
their name, address and credit card number.  This data is stored on the book shop’s  
central computer in a database of customer orders.
 (c) Outline the purpose of protocols in transferring this data. [2]
(d)     (i)     Identify     two sources of risk to personal data in this online system. [2]
(ii)     State     two	measures	that	the	book	shop	can	take	to	address	the	risks	identified	 
in part (d)(i). [2]
(iii) Outline the consequences to the customer if their data is not adequately protected. [2]
