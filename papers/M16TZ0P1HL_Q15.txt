 The letters F
0
, F
1
, F
2
, ..., F
N
 , ..., where N ï‚³ 0, are used to identify the N  th term of the 
sequence of Fibonacci numbers that starts as follows.
0 ,  1 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  5 ,  8 ,  13 , ...
 With the exception of the leading 0 and 1 (the zeroth term and 1st term), the terms in 
the sequence are the sum of the two preceding terms.  For example, F
5
 is the 5th term 
of the sequence, which is 5, and is the sum of the 3rd and 4th terms, which are 2 and 3 
respectively.
 (a) State the value of the 8th term in the sequence. [1]
 The following method, 
fibo(N), generates the N th term in the sequence.  The return 
statement returns the value that the method generates.
	   fibo(N)	
	   	 if	(N=0	OR	N=1)	then
          return     N
      else
	   	   return	(fibo(N-1)	+	fibo(N-2))
     end if
     (b)     Trace     fibo(4), showing the different levels of recursion. [3]
 (c) Construct a non-recursive algorithm to generate Fibonacci numbers. [6]
 (d) Construct an algorithm that will output	the	first	
N terms of the sequence.  You should 
use fibo(),	the	method	defined	above.	[3]
 Recursive programs written in high level languages require the use of particular structures to 
support their execution.
 (e) Describe how a stack is usually employed in the running of a recursive algorithm. [2]
