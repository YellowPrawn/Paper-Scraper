 (a) Calculate the number of bits in each memory location. [1]
 (b) Calculate the number of bytes in each address. [1]
 (c) Outline the function of the:
  (i) memory address register[2]
  (ii) memory data register. [2]
     (d)     (i)     Identify     two functions of the operating system. [2]
  (ii) State where the operating system is held when the computer is turned off.  [1]
 The machine instruction cycle refers to the retrieval of an instruction from the RAM, and 
subsequently decoding, executing and storing the result.
 (e) (i) Construct a diagram to illustrate the structure of a central processing unit (CPU), 
clearly	showing	the	flow	of	data	within	the	CPU.[4]
  (ii) Identify the part of the CPU which performs decoding. [1]
  (iii) Identify the part of the CPU which executes the instruction.[1]
