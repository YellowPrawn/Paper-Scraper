 Harry is Tired (T) depending on the following three variables:
•	Work (W)
•	Hunger (H)
•	Sun (S).
 
Harry is tired if:
• he works and he is hungry
• he works and it is not sunny
• he does not work and is not hungry.
(a)    Represent, as a single logical expression, the conditions that cause Harry to be tired.[3]
(b)    Construct the truth table to show when Harry is tired.
[4]
    A  professor  notices  that  students  are  generally  very  tired  and  decides  to  investigate  the 
relationship of tiredness with Work, Hunger and Sun.
    Consider  the following truth table which  shows  the conditions for Tired based  on  Work,  
Hunger and Sun.

(Question 12 continued)
    The conditions for one of the students to be tired can be expressed in the following array, 
TIRED, where the index is equivalent to the combination of W, H and S in the truth table.
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7]
00100011
TIRED
(c)    Identify a relationship between the value of S and the index of the array TIRED.
[1]
(d)    Construct an algorithm, 
TEST, in pseudocode, to output the conditions W, H and S from 
the array TIRED for a student who is tired.
[4]
A collection,
 STUDENT, is used to hold the name and the array TIRED for each student.
(e)    Outline the way in which your algorithm could be used to output the names of all those 
students who are tired due to Work and Hunger.
