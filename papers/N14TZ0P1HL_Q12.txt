	  Three	IB	  students	are	  working	on	  a	 programming	project.		They	have	    10	  days	   to	  complete	 
the	work.		To	plan	the	project	activities	and	timeline	they	produce	the	following	Gantt	chart.

(a)     State     two	tasks	students	should	perform	to	define	a	problem.
[2]
(b)     Identify     two	tools	or	techniques	that	students	could	use	to	represent	algorithms.
[1]
(c)	  Discuss	whether	beta	testing	would	be	appropriate	in	this	scenario.
[3]
(d)     Outline     three criteria	that	   could	be	  used	   when	deciding	which	programming	language	is	
to	be	used	for	coding.

(e)	  From	the	Gantt	chart	above
      (i)      identify      two tasks that could be done concurrently;
[1]
     (ii)     identify     two	tasks	that	should	be	done	sequentially.
[1]
(f)	  Explain	why	a	Gantt	chart	may	not	be	suitable	for	planning	a	large	business	project.
