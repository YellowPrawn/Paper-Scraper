  Consider the following two-dimensional array, MAT, with dimensions 6 × 6.
[0][1][2][3][4][5]
[0]
700000
[1]
000000
[2]
00−3090
[3]
000000
[4]
00−1000
[5]
0−600−51
 The value −1 is stored in MAT at position [4][2].  The position [4][2] means row 4 
and column 2. 
 (a) State the total number of elements stored in MAT.[1]
 (b)  State the number of non-zero elements in MAT.[1]
 A two-dimensional array in which most of the elements are zero is called a sparse matrix.  
A sparse matrix can be compressed by storing only non-zero elements using three 
one-dimensional arrays.
         The first array, VALUES, stores all non-zero elements taken from the sparse matrix in 
row-major order (left-to-right then top-to-bottom order). 
 The length of the array VALUES is equal to the number of non-zero elements in the sparse 
matrix.  For the sparse matrix above, MAT, the array VALUES is:
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6]
7−39−1−6−51
         The         second array is ROWC.  ROWC[i] stores the number of non-zero elements, from row 0 to 
row i of the sparse matrix, inclusive.  
 The length of ROWC is equal to the number of rows in the sparse matrix.  For MAT the array 
ROWC is:
[0][1][2][3][4][5]
113347
 For example, ROWC[2] stores 3 because in MAT there are three non-zero elements from 
row 0 to row 2, inclusive.
 
         The         third array, COL, stores the column index for each non-zero element in the sparse 
matrix.  COL[i] stores the sparse matrix column index for the non-zero element stored in 
VALUES[i].  For MAT the array COL is:
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6]
0242145

(Question 14 continued)
(c) Construct an algorithm that compresses a 6 × 6 two-dimensional array, such as MAT, 
into the three one-dimensional arrays described on page 8.  You may assume that the 
6 × 6 array is inputted and all three one-dimensional arrays are initialized.[6]
 Consider the following three arrays.  They hold the compressed contents of a 7 × 7 sparse 
matrix, BIGMAT.
VALUES
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]
15203743576070899092
ROWC
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6]
13455710
COL
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]
0121301056
 (d) For a given column, C, in BIGMAT, outline how it could be determined that this column 
contains no non-zero elements.[2]
 (e) State how many rows in BIGMAT contain only zeros. 
[1]
 (f) (i) State the index in VALUES of the first non-zero element in row 5 of BIGMAT.[1]
  (ii) For a given row, R, in BIGMAT, determine the range of indexes in VALUES where 
non-zero elements in row R of BIGMAT are placed.  You may assume that there 
is at least one non-zero element in row R.[3]
