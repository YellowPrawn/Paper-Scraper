Each object in the collection contains the following information:\n                  ID:\t\tunique\tflight\tnumber\n                  PLACE: where the plane is coming from\n                  DUE: the time it is scheduled to arrive\n                  EXPECTED: the time it is expected to arrive (only if it is early or if it is delayed)\n                  ARRIVED: the time of actual arrival.\n EXPECTED and ARRIVED are blank at the beginning of the day and the collection is sorted in \norder of DUE.\n A screen in the airport can display information on 20 planes at a time, which are held in a \nlinked list.\n (a)     Describe the features of a linked list of 20 planes that have the above information. [3]\n All times are stored in the collection as the number of minutes since midnight.  However they \nare displayed on the screen in 24-hour format (for example, 10:58 is stored in the collection \nas 658).\n (b)     Construct an algorithm to convert the times held in the collection into hours and \nminutes needed for the 24-hour format displayed on the screen. [3]\n If a plane arrived more than 30 minutes ago it is removed from the linked list and the next \none in the collection is added to the end of the list.\n (c)     With the aid of a diagram, explain how a plane which arrived more than 30 minutes ago \ncould be removed from the linked list. [4]\n (d)     For the application described above, compare the use of a linked list with the use of a \nqueue of objects.   [5]\nM15/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX\n\n– 8 –","root":"M154COMSCHP1ENGTZ0XX",
