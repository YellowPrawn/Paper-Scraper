{"classification":"topic 7","question":"\n\n  A biotechnology company owns a resource centre which collects and classifies organisms  \nfor use in research.\n  Only authorized employees are allowed access to some laboratories in the resource centre. \n These laboratories are protected by locked doors.  Each door is controlled by a separate \nmicroprocessor.  A digital camera is used to scan the iris of an employee who wishes to \nenter the lab.  If the employee is authorized the doors are unlocked.\n     (a)     Identify     two benefits of using a digital camera as an input device in this control system.[2]\n (b) Outline the use of a microprocessor in this control system.  [2]\n (c)  Outline the function of an output transducer.[2]\n The company is planning to use a centralized computer system to secure the resource \ncentre’s building. \n (d) Compare a centrally controlled system with the system described above. [4]\n The operating system has an important role in this system.\n     (e)     Identify     two functions of the operating system.
