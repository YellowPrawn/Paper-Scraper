{"classification":"topic 1","question":"\n\n  An application package used in an office includes a word processor. \n (a) Describe how a spellchecker checks whether a word in a text file is correctly spelt \nor not.[2]\n The office manager decides to buy and install new software and hardware. \n     (b)     Outline     one problem that may arise from the installation of new hardware and software \nin the office.[2]\n The changeover to the new system can be achieved by either direct changeover or \nphased conversion.\n (c)  Compare direct changeover and phased conversion.[4]\n The new software allows basic text summaries and analysis to help check text files, \nincluding functions such as calculating word frequency.\n (d)     Identify     one way of testing this software.[1]\n One of the methods in this software is findFirst(CH,\tCHARARRAY) which accepts a \ncharacter, CH, and a one-dimensional array of characters, CHARARRAY, and returns the \nposition of the first occurrence of character CH in CHARARRAY.  It returns −1 if CH does not \nappear in the array CHARARRAY.\nFor example, consider the character array MESSAGE, which is of length 19.\n[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18]\nAURORAMUSISAMICA.\n For this array:\n yThe character at position 8 in the sentence is “U” and hence MESSAGE[8] = \"U\". \n yThe character at position 18 in the sentence is “.” and hence MESSAGE[18]\t=\t\".\".\n yThe method findFirst('A',\tMESSAGE) returns 0.\n yThe method findFirst('S',\tMESSAGE) returns 9.\n yThe method findFirst('Z',\tMESSAGE) returns −1.\n (e) Construct an efficient algorithm for the method findFirst().  You should use the \nfunction len(), which returns the number of characters in an array (for example, \nlen(MESSAGE) returns 19).[6]\n– 4 –N17/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX\n","root":"N17TZ0P1HL","difficulty":"hard"}
