{"classification":"topic 7","question":"\n\n An oil and gas company has a networked computer system for use of their employees in the \nHead Office.\n(a)  (i)   Identify one hardware security measure that will ensure that confidential data \nfrom the Head Office cannot be accessed. [1]\n(ii)  Identify one software security measure that will ensure that confidential data from \nthe Head Office cannot be accessed. [1]\nThe company also uses the internet to enable communication with employees working on \nexploration and production in many remote geographical areas.\n(b) Identify one network security measure. [1]\nThe sub-sea oil and gas exploration and production unit of the company relies on thousands \nof kilometres of pipeline which are monitored by a computer control system which can detect \nleaks.\n(c) Explain the environmental benefit of using a computer control system to monitor the \npipeline.
