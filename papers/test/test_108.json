{"classification":"topic 4","question":"\n\n A sub-program all_even() accepts a positive integer N and outputs true if all digits of N \nare even, otherwise it outputs false.  For example, all_even(246) outputs true and  \nall_even(256) outputs false.\nThe following algorithm is constructed for the sub-program \nall_even(N).\n \n EVEN = true\n loop while (N > 0) and (EVEN = true)\n     if (N mod 10)mod 2 = 1 then\n               EVEN     =     false\n          end     if\n end loop\n output EVEN\n (a) Explain why this algorithm does not obtain the correct result.[2]\n (b) Outline what should be changed in the algorithm to obtain the correct result.
