{"classification":"topic 5","question":"\n\n The collection WEATHER contains the temperatures that have been measured for one city \nover the course of one week, starting on Monday and ending on Sunday.  Each day,  \n24 readings were taken, one each hour, the first\tbeing\tat\t00:00,\tthe\tsecond\tat\t01:00\tand\tso\t\non.  The data is stored in chronological order with the data for Monday stored in the collection \nfirst,\tfollowed\tby\tTuesday and so on.\n         (a)         State the total number of readings that were taken during this week.
