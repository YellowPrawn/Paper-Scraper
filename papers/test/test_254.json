Each set of H’s of the same size is called a generation.\n(c) Construct an algorithm that will draw an initial H in the centre of the display and three \ngenerations after that.\n[6]\n(d) State how many endpoints there will be after the initial H and three generations have been \ndrawn, without any consideration of the size.  \n[1]\n(e) Suggest how drawing this pattern of H’s could be done recursively.\n[3]\n\n2214-7011\n– 8 –\nM14/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX","root":"M14TZ0P1HL","difficulty":"hard"}
