{"classification":"topic 5","question":"\n\n The faceplate of a car stereo has six buttons for selecting one of six preferred radio stations.  \nAs part of the internal representation of a microprocessor there is an array with six positions, \ncarrying the information about the radio frequencies, as follows.\nRadio\n[0][1][2][3][4][5]\n100.488.790.2104.593.8106.2\n(a) State the information at Radio[2].  \n[1]\n(b)    Outline how a numerical frequency could be stored in a fixed-length string. \n[2]\n(c)   Construct   an   algorithm   in   pseudocode   that   calculates   the   range   of   frequencies    \n(ie the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies) of any set of six selected \nradio stations. \n[6]\nThe  two-dimensional  array  \nStats provides an indication of how often a specific station is \nlistened to by the user.  For each button in the faceplate it records how often it has been clicked \nin the last 48 hours.  \nStats is ordered by the second column. \n513\n49\n08\n34\n13\n22\nStats\nBoth Radio and Stats are used by a procedure that allows the user to access the radio frequencies \nthat are listened to most often, as recorded in \nStats, by flicking a lever on the steering wheel.  \nThe frequencies are accessed cyclically, ie after the least used frequency the procedure returns \nto the most used.  For this reason a queue Q is used.\n(d)  Construct  an  algorithm  in  pseudocode  that,  by  using  the  structures  \nRadio  and  Stats, \nperforms the following steps:\n• it inserts the radio frequencies in the queue Q, following the actual order of preference; \nand then\n• it uses the queue Q, cyclically, to output an element each time the lever is flicked.\n[6]\n\n2214-7011\n– 6 –\nM14/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX","root":"M14TZ0P1HL","difficulty":"hard"}
