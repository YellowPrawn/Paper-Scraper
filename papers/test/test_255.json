{"classification":"topic 5","question":"\n A suburban railway system for a large city in Southern Europe consists of two lines L1 and L2,  \nwhich  meet  at  the  station  Centro,  where  passengers  can  change  from  one  line  to  the  other.     \nThe system is shown below.\nL1\nL2\nZONE 4ZONE 3ZONE 2ZONE 1ZONE 0\nPlaza \nMayor\nFuengirola\nPrados\nLima\nDavid\nCol\nCentro\nTorrox\nLomas\nAlamo\nAlora\nPizarra\nEach station is located in a particular zone, and the total number of zones in which the journey \ntakes place determines the train fare.  Note, if a passenger starts in Zone 1, goes to Zone 0 and \nthen back to Zone 1, the journey has taken place in three zones.  Examples of the number of \nzones are shown below for different journeys.\nTravelling fromTravelling toNumber of zones \nLimaPlaza Mayor1\nAloraPlaza Mayor7\nLomasCol4\n(a) State the number of zones in which the journey takes place when travelling from Alora  \nto Fuengirola. \n[1]\nThe  data  for  each  station  (station  name,  line,  zone)  is  stored  on  the  system’s  server  in  the  \ncollection \nTRAIN_DATA.  There are 12 stations in total.  The first part of the collection is  \nshown below.\nCentro,  L1,  0,  Alora,  L1,  3,  Torrox,  L1,  1,  Col,  L2,  1,  ... \nFrom this we can see that Alora is part of line L1 and is located in Zone 3.\nAt the start of each day, the data in \nTRAIN_DATA is read in to the binary tree TREE, in which \neach node will hold the data for one station.  The binary tree will be used to search for a specific \nstation’s name.\n(b)    Sketch  the  binary  tree  after  the  station  data  from  the  first  part  of  the  collection,  \ngiven above, has been added.\n[3]\n(This question continues on the following page) \n\n2214-7011\n– 9 –\nM14/4/COMSC/HP1/ENG/TZ0/XX\n(Question 15 continued)\nThe \nTRAIN_DATA   collection   is   also   used   to   construct   the   one-dimensional   array    \nSTATIONS  (which  only  contains  the  list  of  station  names  sorted  into  alphabetical  order),   \nwhere \nSTATIONS[0] = Alamo.\n(c) State the value of \nSTATIONS[4]. \n[1]\nThe two data structures (\nSTATIONS and TREE) are now used to construct the two-dimensional \narray \nFARES containing the fares between stations, partly shown below.  Note that the fare for \ntravelling in each zone is €1.00. \nFARES\nAlamoAloraCentroCol...\nAlamo01.004.005.00...\nAlora1.0004.005.00...\nCentro4.004.0002.00...\nCol5.005.002.000...\n.................. etc\n(d) Calculate the fare for travelling from Torrox to Lima.\n[1]\n(e)  Construct  the  algorithm  that  would  calculate  the  fares  for  this  two-dimensional  array.     \nYou can make use of the following two sub-procedures:\n• TREE.getZone(STATION) // which returns the zone in which the \n  // station is located\n• TREE.getLine(STATION) // which returns the line on which the \n    //     station is located\nYour algorithm should make as few calculations as possible.\n[9]","root":"M14TZ0P1HL","difficulty":"hard"}
