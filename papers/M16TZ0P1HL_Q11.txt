	   An	examination	office	of	a	university	must	securely	store	studentsâ€™	examination	papers	and	
their	grades.		The	office	keeps	the	documentation	of	past	students	for	two	years.		After	two	
years	the	office	only	stores	the	student	grades.		All	documentation	of	current	students	is	
frequently accessed for other operations and the volume of the data increases quickly. 
	To	better	support	its	operations,	the	office	is	creating	a	new	system	to	provide	this	storage.	
     (a)     Identify     two aspects of the data that need to be taken into account during the planning 
of the new system. [2]
 (b) Describe how direct observations on the current system may provide information to 
help propose a suitable new system. [3]
	A	prototype	of	the	new	system	is	created	to	present	to	the	examination	office.
 (c) Describe the purpose of this prototype.  [3]
	The	examination	office	needs	to	upgrade	the	computing	resources	for	their	operations,	and	
this will require data migration.
     (d)     Discuss     two possible problems that may occur during data migration. [4]
     (e)     Outline     one	economic	aspect	that	the	examination	office	needs	to	take	into	account	to	
support parallel running. [3]
