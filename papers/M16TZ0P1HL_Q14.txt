 LookUpLunch is an app for a Smartphone that can be used to search for restaurants located 
in	zones	of	increasing	distance	from	the	user’s	current	position.		The	diagram	shows	the	user	
and zones as they would appear on a map of the area.

 A search in Norway produced the following table, RESULTS, which shows the number of 
restaurants in each zone.  RESULTS also displays the average price for a meal, expressed in 
the local currency (Norwegian Krone, NOK).

(Question 14 continued)
 Another Smartphone app that is linked to LookUpLunch	collects	customers’	reviews	for	
restaurants.
 A review consists of whether a customer likes the restaurant, and a rating of cheap (C), 
medium (M) or expensive (E).  The app combines all of the reviews to produce a single letter 
rating (
C, M or E) and a total number of likes for the restaurant.
 
 As part of the internal representation of the app, the collection LIKES is used.  Some of the 
data items contained in 
LIKES are shown below.  Each individual data item is separated by  
a comma.
 
0,26,TomHus,M,1,14,GladLaks,E,2,1,MerPoteter,C,1,15,Linie,E,0,2,Mezze,M...
 The restaurant GladLaks, underlined as an example, is located within zone [1].  Based on the 
reviews, this restaurant has 14 likes and is expensive.
 (c) Construct an algorithm that outputs the name of the restaurant with the most likes in 
zone [1].  [5]
 (d) By making use of binary trees and the collection 
LIKES, explain how a list could be 
produced that shows the restaurants in order of zone and then, within each zone, in 
order of popularity.  [3]
 Individual restaurants are able to use this app to see reviews from their customers.
     (e)     Describe     one disadvantage of the use of feedback from social networking in relation to 
business.    [2]
