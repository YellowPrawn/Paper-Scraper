 A laptop computer supplements its primary memory by making use of virtual memory.
         (a)         Outline the use of paging in relation to virtual memory.[2]
 
 The laptop has 1GB of random access memory (RAM) and a single processor.
 The laptop is using one of the latest operating systems to run multimedia gaming programs.  
         (b)         Explain the limitations and consequences of using the laptop for this purpose.[3]
 One of the laptop’s game applications stores the data relating to the different actions of one 
of its characters in a stack.
         (c)         Suggest one reason why the character’s actions might be stored in a stack.[2]
 At	specific	moments	during	the	game	this	data is read from the stack (S) into a queue (Q).
         (d)         Using appropriate access methods for stacks and queues, construct an algorithm that 
reads the data from the stack and enters it into the queue.  You should assume that the 
queue structure exists and that both structures	are	of	a	fixed	size.[6]
         (e)         Outline one advantage of making the queue dynamic.[2]
