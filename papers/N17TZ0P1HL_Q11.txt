 A wireless local area network (WLAN) is used to extend access to a school’s wired  
local area network. 
     (a)     Identify     one hardware component of the WLAN, other than computers.[1]
 The advantages of this WLAN are user-mobility and economical access points. 
     (b)     Outline     two disadvantages of this WLAN. [4]
 (c)  Identify three ways in which the network administrator can reduce the risk of 
unauthorized access to confidential data.[3]
 The concept of packet data transmission is used within this network. 
 Figure 1 shows the simplified structure of a data packet.
