  A character array S holds the word “PSEUDOCODE”.
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]
PSEUDOCODE
 (a) State the index of character “U” in the array S.[1]
 (b) Consider the following algorithm.  The function len() returns the number of characters 
in an array (for example, len(S) is 10).
      K = 0
      CL = 0
      loop while K < len(S)
           if S[K] = "E" then
             CL = CL + 1
               end     if
           K = K + 1
          end     loop
          output     CL
  For this algorithm, copy and complete the following trace table.[4]
KCLK < len(S)S[K] = "E"output

 A simple method of encoding a message is to use substitutions to produce a cryptogram.  
 
 Given a positive integer N and the array UPCASELETTERS containing letters in alphabetical 
order, a new array SUBSTITUTE is created by shifting the entire contents of UPCASELETTERS 
to the left, N	times.		As	an	element	moves	off	the	left	of	the	array,	it	moves	back	into	the	right	
side of the array.
 For example, given the array UPCASELETTERS:
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
         When         N = 5 the array SUBSTITUTE will be:
[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25]
FGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDE
 (c) Construct an algorithm which creates the array SUBSTITUTE.  You may assume that a 
positive integer N and array UPCASELETTERS are given.[5]

(Question 13 continued)
 This encoding method produces a cryptogram of a sentence by replacing each uppercase 
letter of the sentence with its substitute.  Other characters in the sentence are not changed.
 For example, using the arrays shown on page 6:
  Input (sentence): ARS LONGA, VITA BREVIS.
  Output (cryptogram): FWX QTSLF, ANYF GWJANX. 
 The following algorithm fragment inputs the characters, one by one, from the input sentence, 
and outputs its cryptogram using the method encode().
 loop while NOT end-of-input-sentence
      CH = input()
      CRYPTEDCH= encode(CH, UPCASELETTERS, SUBSTITUTE)
          output     CRYPTEDCH
 end loop
 The method encode() accepts a character CH and two arrays UPCASELETTERS and 
SUBSTITUTE,	as	defined	above,	and	returns	the	corresponding	character	CRYPTEDCH of the 
character CH.
 (d) Explain the steps to construct an algorithm for the method encode().[5]
