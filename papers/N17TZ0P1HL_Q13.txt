  (a) Describe the features of a dynamic data structure.[2]
 Consider the following doubly linked list which holds the names of flowers in 
alphabetical order.
 
 
                                 
 
 
Camellia
  
 
Lavender

Aster

 (b) Explain how “Primrose” could be inserted into this doubly linked list.  You should draw 
a labelled diagram in your answer. 
 Consider the two stacks: FLOWERS and FRUITS.

 (c) Show the output produced by the following algorithm.  [4]
	   	 	 loop	while	(NOT	FRUITS.isEmpty())	AND	(NOT	FLOWERS.isEmpty())
	   	 	 	 X	=	FRUITS.pop()
	   	 	 	 Y	=	FLOWERS.pop()
	   	 	 	 if	X	<	Y	then
            output  X
          else
	   	 	 	 	 output	Y
          end  if
        end  loop
 A third stack, FLOFRU, is needed.  It should contain all the data from FLOWERS and FRUITS 
and will store it as shown below 
FLOFRU
Yarrow
Primrose
Lavender
Day	Lily
Camellia
Broom
Aster
Pear
Orange
Cherry
Apple
 (d) Describe how the FLOFRU stack could be created.   [3]
