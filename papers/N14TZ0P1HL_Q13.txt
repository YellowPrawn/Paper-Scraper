	  An	automated	security	system	monitors	a	prison.
(a)	  Suggest	the	sensors	that	could	be	used	to	detect	any	person	crossing	the	perimeter.
[2]
A	team	   of	 security	guards	patrols	the	  perimeter	of	 the	  prison	at	 night.		The	   guards	each	   carry	a	
device	incorporating	a	GPS	that	links	to	the	prison’s	security	system.
(b)	  Outline	a	suitable	output	that	would	notify	a	guard	that	a	prisoner	has	escaped.
[2]
The	guards’	GPS	devices	transmit	information	to	the	security	system.
(c)	  Suggest	the	most	suitable	method	for	the	transmission
	    (i)	  between	the	perimeter’s	sensors	and	the	security	system;
[1]
	    (ii)	  between	the	security	system	and	the	guards’	devices.
[1]
(d)     State     one	   method	of	  network	security	that	   could	be	  used	when	transmitting	the	 
GPS	information.
[1]
(e)	  Outline	how	this	GPS	information	may	be	used	once	transmitted	to	the	security	system.
[2]
There	are	other	situations	where	people	may	be	required	to	carry	GPS	devices.
(f)	  Discuss	the	ethical	implications	of	insisting	people	carry	GPS	devices.
