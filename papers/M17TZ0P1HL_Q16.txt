 An embedded system is used to control the speed of an electric motor.
         (a)         With	reference	to	the	example,	above,	define	an	embedded	system.	[2]
 The diagram shows the main components in a typical negative feedback system.

 The control system for the electric motor consists of a negative feedback loop. 
         (b)         Outline the desired outcome of any feedback system.[2]
         (c)         List the steps involved in the feedback system for the electric motor.  You should make 
use of the appropriate technical terms of the control system process.[6]
 A more complex control system is used to monitor and control the functioning of a  
power station.  This includes a dedicated operating system with sensors and output 
transducers (actuators) placed at various places around the power station.
         (d)         Explain	the	interaction	between	the	components	identified	above,	if	interrupts	are	
generated by the sensors.[5]
