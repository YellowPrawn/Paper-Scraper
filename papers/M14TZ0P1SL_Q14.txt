    The faceplate of a car stereo has six buttons for selecting one of six preferred radio stations.  
As part of the internal representation of a microprocessor there is an array with six positions, 
carrying the information about the radio frequencies, as follows.
Radio
[0][1][2][3][4][5]
100.488.790.2104.593.8106.2
(a)    State the information at Radio[2].
[1]
(b)    Outline how a numerical frequency could be stored in a fixed-length string.
[2]
(c)    Construct  an  algorithm,  in  pseudocode,  that  calculates  the  range  of  frequencies  
(ie the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies) of any set of six selected 
radio stations.
[6]
A display in the faceplate shows the name and frequency of the selected radio station.  The name 
is automatically captured when storing a preference.
(d)    Outline how a collection of objects could be used to store the name and frequency data in 
the radio. 
[2]
(e)    Construct an algorithm, in pseudocode, to access and display the name and frequency of 
a station when a button is pressed.
