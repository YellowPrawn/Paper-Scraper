 An insurance company holds a large database of information about its customers, including 
the date of their next payment.
 Once a month the database is searched to compile the following lists:
•	list 1: customers whose next payment date will be within the next 30 days
•	list 2: customers whose payment date has passed by more than 14 days but less than, 
or equal to, 30 days
•	list 3: customers whose payment date has passed by more than 30 days.
 Customers who are in list 3 are flagged for deletion.
 (a)  Construct an algorithm to illustrate the monthly process described above. [6]
 After the lists have been compiled, the following messages are sent out to customers.  
•	A reminder is sent to customers in list 1. 
•	A warning that payments are more than 14 days overdue is sent to customers in list 2.
•	A cancellation of contract is sent to customers in list 3.
 (b)  Explain how the lists could be used to merge the data from the database with a 
word processor to create these messages automatically for sending either by post or 
by email. [4]
 (c)  Outline the consequences of data loss to customers and to the company.  [2]
 (d)  Describe one method that the company could use to prevent data loss. [3]
