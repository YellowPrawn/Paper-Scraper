(b) With reference to sensors, transducers and the processor, explain the control process 
that	takes	place	in	the	greenhouse	(glasshouses).			[5]
(c)	Outline	the	role	of	the	operating	system	specific	to	this	scenario.			[4]
(d) Describe the difference between polling and interrupt in the event that some of the 
sensors malfunction. [3]
