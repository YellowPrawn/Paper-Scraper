 In a school there are 2400 students and each student uses one locker.  Each locker has a unique 
number from 1 to 2400.
 The lockers are to be painted in four colours: red, white, yellow and blue, in order of locker 
numbers, as shown in the following table.
Locker 
Number
12345678...23992400
Colourredwhiteyellowblueredwhiteyellowblue...yellowblue
The	pattern	of	colours	continues	in	this	manner.		For	example,	locker	number	15	will	be	 
painted yellow.
(a) State the colour that locker number 442 will be painted. [1]
Each student is responsible for painting his or her locker.  Some students do not know how  
to determine the colour they should use.
(b) Construct, in pseudocode, an algorithm that accepts a locker number as input,  
and	outputs	the	colour	that	this	locker	should	be	painted.	[5]
Three arrays are used to hold the following information:
• the names of students in alphabetical order, are held in the array 
STUDENT_NAME[];
• the corresponding locker number is held in the array LOCKER_NO[];
• whether the locker has been painted or not is held in the array 
PAINTED[].

For example STUDENT_NAME[1]	is	Sarah	Anner.		She	is	responsible	for	locker	number	1256	
and this locker has not been painted yet.
(c)     (i)     State the name of the student who is responsible for painting locker number 811.             [1]
(ii) Construct, in pseudocode, an algorithm that counts and outputs the number of 
lockers that have been painted so far.

(d)	    Describe	an	efficient	algorithm,	which	accepts	a	student’s	name	as	input,	and	outputs	
the corresponding locker number and whether or not it has been painted. [4]
