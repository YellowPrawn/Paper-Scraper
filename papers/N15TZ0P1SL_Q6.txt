 A sub-program all_even() accepts a positive integer N and outputs true if all digits of N 
are even, otherwise it outputs false.  For example, all_even(246) outputs true and  
all_even(256) outputs false.
The following algorithm is constructed for the sub-program 
all_even(N).
 
 EVEN = true
 loop while (N > 0) and (EVEN = true)
     if (N mod 10)mod 2 = 1 then
               EVEN     =     false
          end     if
 end loop
 output EVEN
