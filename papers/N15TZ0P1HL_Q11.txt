 A population study divides a metropolitan area into seven regions: A–G.
 The following table shows the current population (in millions) of the regions.
RegionCurrent population 
(millions)
A2.3
B2.1
C1.2
D1.4
E1.5
F1.1
G0.8
 Two one-dimensional arrays, 
Region and Curr_Pop, are used to hold this data. 
 For example, 
Region[0] ='A'.  The population in region A is 2.3 million and 2.3 is found in 
Curr_Pop[0].
 (a) Construct the algorithm that will output the total population in the metropolitan area.[3]
 The numbers in the following table represent expected percentages of yearly migration from 
one region to another, obtained by analysing historical migration data.  For example, it is 
expected that 0.32 % of the current population of region B will move to region C.
 The diagonal entries represent a region’s internal growth rate.  For example, the population 
of region C is expected to increase by 1.2 % as a result of the births and deaths of people 
currently living in region C.

(Question 11 continued)
 (b) (i) State the percentage of the population of region G that are expected to move to 
region A.[1]
                  (ii)         Determine         the         number of people from region B who are expected to move to 
region E.[1]
  (iii) Describe how the change in population of region F in one year could be 
determined. [3]
 (c) Construct the algorithm that will predict the population in each region after 10 years.  
You should assume that the yearly migration percentages, given in the table on page 8, 
remain the same over the 10 years.[7]
