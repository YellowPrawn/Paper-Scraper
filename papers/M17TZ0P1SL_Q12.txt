    (a)    By copying the table below, trace the following algorithm using the data in the 
collection DATA.  Note: B and C are also collections and are initially empty.
     DATA = {2,4,-1,3} 
     loop while DATA.hasNext()
         A = DATA.getNext()
         if A >= 0 then
           if A mod 2 = 0 then
              B.addItem(A)
            else
              C.addItem(A)
            end  if
               end     if
          end     loop
DATA.hasNext() ?AA >= 0?A mod 2 = 0?

         (b)         Outline the steps involved in performing a binary search on an array of ascending 
numbers.  Note: you can assume that the search value is present in the array and that 
initially LOW is the index	of	the	first	value	in	the	array	and	HI is the index of the last value.[4]
 
         (c)         A collection called NUMBERS	is	to	be	searched	to	see	if	it	contains	a	specified	value.		
Construct an algorithm in pseudocode to perform the following:
yyinput the number, S, to be searched for
yyread in the values from the NUMBERS collection into the array D.  Note: you can 
assume that the array is large enough and that the collection is not empty
yyperform a linear search for S on the array D  
yyoutput the message “found” or “not found” as appropriate.[5]
 
 A binary search can be performed on the array D, if the values in D are in ascending order.   
As the values are being read from NUMBERS into D they are checked to see if they are in order.  
         (d)         Without writing pseudocode, suggest how this check could be performed.[3]
