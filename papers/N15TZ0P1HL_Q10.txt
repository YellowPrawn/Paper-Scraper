 The table below holds student names and scores, from a class test.

 (a) Draw a diagram to show how the data given in the table could be stored in a binary tree 
in the order of scores.  Data should be inserted into the binary tree in the order given in 
the table (ie	data	about	Ann	Taylor	is	to	be	inserted	first).[3]
 (b) The same data could be inserted into a singly linked list in descending order of scores.  
Draw a diagram of this singly linked list.[3]
 (c) Compare the data structures in part (a) and part (b) in terms of:
                  (i)         searching[2]
                  (ii)         storage         requirements.         [2]
 (d) Consider the following recursive algorithm, in which 
X and Y are parameters in the 
method F.  The return statement gives the value that the method generates.
          F(X,Y)
         if X < Y then
                    return     F(X+1,Y-2)
         else if X = Y
                    return     2*F(X+2,Y-2)-2
               else
                    return     2*X+4*Y
               end     if
                  
  Determine the value of F(5,11).[5]
