 In	a	town,	a	set	of	traffic	lights	control	access	from	a	small	road,	where	a	fire	station	is	
located,	to	a	main	road	that	has	heavy	traffic.		In	times	of	emergency,	many	vehicles	from	
the	fire	station	may	need	to	leave	the	station	at	the	same	time.		A	system	is	put	in	place	so	
that	when	a	fire	truck	on	the	small	road	approaches	the	main	road,	the	traffic	lights	switch	to	
green (Go) on the small road and to red (Stop) on the main road.

	   (a)	 Outline	the	role	of	sensors	and	a	microprocessor	in	controlling	the	traffic	lights	in	 
this way.        [4]
	   (b)	 Suggest	how	the	traffic	lights	can	be	changed	back	to	their	original	state	once	there	are	
no	more	fire	trucks	coming	from	the	small	road.	[3]
	   These	traffic	lights	are	controlled	by	embedded	systems	at	the	point	of	use.		It	is	proposed	
that	they	should	be	controlled	from	the	same	central	computer	as	all	the	other	traffic	lights	in	
the town.
 (c) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages	of	running	the	town’s	traffic	light	system	
on one central computer with multiple inputs and outputs. [5]
	   A	series	of	cameras	are	installed	at	each	of	the	town’s	traffic	lights.		These	cameras	are	
connected to the central computer.
	   (d)	 Discuss	the	social	implications	of	monitoring	traffic	in	this	way.	[3]
