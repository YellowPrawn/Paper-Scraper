to the server by cable.  There is also a wireless connection. 
     (c)     Outline     one advantage and one disadvantage of allowing wireless access to the server. [4]
 Print jobs are sent to a shared printer from all workstations and added to the print queue 
in the order in which they are sent.  A priority is given to each job based on the number of 
pages requested. 
•	The highest priority (1) is given to jobs with 1–3 pages. 
•	The lowest priority (4) is given to jobs with more than 50 pages.
 The jobs sent to the printer are held in a collection of objects.  Each object includes the 
priority that has been given and the time it was sent to be printed.
 If any job has been waiting more than 10 minutes it is moved to the front of the queue and is 
the next to be printed.
