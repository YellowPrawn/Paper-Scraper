 Consider the following recursive method, where N is a positive integer 
     mystery(N)
     if (N > 0) AND (N mod 2 = 0) then
	   	 	 mystery(N−2)
     end if
     output N
 end mystery
 (a) Determine the output produced by the method call mystery(5).[1]
 (b) Determine the output produced by the method call mystery(4).[3]
 (c) Construct an iterative algorithm for the method mystery(), which uses a single 
while loop instead of recursion.[4]
